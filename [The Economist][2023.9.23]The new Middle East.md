​     `The new Middle East  `

 `More money and less mayhem. For now `  

​     `IF YOU THOUGHT the Middle East was stagnant, think again.  The Gulf economies are among the richest and most vibrant  on the planet. helped by a Brent crude oil price that rose back to  over $90 per barrel this week. A S3-5trn fossil-fuel bonanza is be-  ing spent on everything from home-grown artificial in telligence  models and shiny new cities in the desert, to filling the coffersof  giant sovereign-wealth funds that roam the world's capital mar-  kets looking for deals. `  

​     `As the cash flows in, the chaos shows signs of receding,  thanks to the biggest burstof diplomacy for decades. Saudi Ara-  bia and Iran have negotiated detente in a rivalry that has lasted  since the Iranian revolution in 1979. Civil wars in Syria and Ye-  men are killing fewer people, as their sponsors seek de-escala-  tion. Following the Abraham accords between Israel and some  Arab governments, Saudi Arabia is considering recognising the  Jewish state, 75 years after its creation. The region's global clout  is rising—four countries are about to join the BRICS club of none  aligned powers that want a less Western-dominated world. `  

​     `As our Briefing explains, these shifts begin a new chapter in  the Middle East marked by fresh opportunities and new dangers.  The region's leaders are testing ideas  much of the world, including embracing autocratic pragmatism  as a substi tute for democracy, and multipolar diplomacy instead  of the post-1945 American-led order. The Mid-  dle East is also a place where threats that will  menace the world in the 2030s may play out  early, including nuclear proliferation, extreme  weather and even greater inequality, as weak  countries fall further behind. `  

​     `Many occupants of the White House have  left office wishing they could forget all about  the Middle East. But whether you run a super-  power or a small business, it matters as much as ever. Although  it has only 6% of the world's people, it has a chokeholWon the  global economy. As the lowest-cost oil producer, its share of  crude exports is 46% and rising. Its share of exports of liquefied  natural gas, in great demand since Russia's pipelines to Europe  shut down, is 30% and going up, too. Thanks to its location, 30%  of all container trade and 16% of air cargo passes through the re-  gion. With $3trn of assets, its sovereign-wealth funds are among  the world's largest. Its wars and disorder often spill across bor-  ders; its refugees affect politics as far away as Europe. `  

​     `The past two decades have been miserablein the Middle East.  Democratic projects ended in failure and bloodshed, in Iraq after  the American-led invasion of 2003 and in several countries after  the Arab spring in 2011. Islamic State sought to kill its way tocre-  ating a caliphate, while in Svria Bashar al-Assad dovsed his own  people in chlorine and nerve agents。`

 `Yet now, as the fighting ebbs, three big changes are visible.  First, the region is having to take more responsibility for its own  security, as America's appetite to intervene militarily has evapo-  rated. Alongside this, trade patterns have become multipolar:  the IMF reckons26% of Middle Eastern goods exports go to Chi-  na and India, almost double the level in 2000 and roughly twice  the share headed for America and Europe. Recently, this geopolitical realignment has led to a desire to de-escalate conflicts.  `

 `Second, the energy transition creates an urgent need to es-  cape the familiar pattern of oil booms and busts. Instead there is  a powerful incentive for the Gulf to lift fossil-fuel production in  the next decade before demand dwindles permanently, and  spend the proceeds on diversifying local economies. `    

​     `The final shift is a weariness in public opinion. Political ex-  periments, whether democratic or Islamist, are tarnished. In-  stead, people across the Middle East yearn for economic oppor-  tunity. Forget Canada or Sweden: polls show the country young  Arabs admire most is the UAE, with its stability and thriving  economy under iron-fisted dynastic rule. At the same time, less  Western involvement in security and trade also means less pres-  sure for human rights or democracy. `  

​     `Some of the region's changes invite ridicule—think of a van-  ity project like NEOM, a gaudy new city being built for an esti-  mated $500bn by Muhammad bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's de fac-  tm ruler. But other changes are durable and profound. More  women are working in the Gulf. Israeli tourists are thronging to  Dubai. Across the region, the non-oil economy is growing at a  healthy annual rate of 4% and cross-border multinational in-  vestment is rising. It is possible to imagine how a virtuous cycle  of stability and peace might lead to more investment and trade  that raises living standards and broadens pros-  perity, reversing a long-lasting spiral of failure  in a part of the world with some 500m people. `  

​     `Yet to achieve that, the Middle East will have  to overcome some big problems. Many of these  are familiar. The region's more enlightened  autocrats argue that they face a kind of  mance accountability" to improve the Inr of  their populations. But regimes with absolute  rule tend towards decay. Other dangers are new—or, rather,  looming more menacingly than ever. Now that Iran is on the  threshold of becoming a nuclear-armed state, proliferation is a  grave worry (see Middle East & Africa section). Climate change  means that one of the world's hottest, driest places faces even  more extreme weather. Only some countries can afford the in-  vestments, such as redesigned cities and desalination projects,  that they need to remain habitable. `  

`80:20 rule  `

 `Most starkly, new Middle East is more lopsided than in re-  cent memory. The success stories, the Gulf and Israel, account  for only 14% of the population but 60% of GDP, 73% of goods ex-  ports and 75% of inward multinationalånvestment. From Israel  and the West Bank to Saudi Arabia and Yemen, modern econo-  mies border places trapped in despair. Lebanon is mired in financial crisis; Egypt could be heading the same way. The new  Middle East's Winners embody a transactional mindset that may  yet make them richer. Its losers are a reminder that in a world  with fewer rules and principles, no one is coming to the rescue.  As you fill up your car or wait for your air-freighted•parcel, re-  member they depend on a region that is an economic and political laboratory—and hope the experiment does not bloW UP `
